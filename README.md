Implementation of a Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System [6], a general-purpose reasoner that adapts under the Assumption of Insufficient Knowledge and Resources [7].

This is a completely new platform and not branched from the existing OpenNARS codebase. The ONA (OpenNARS for Applications) system [1] takes the logic and conceptual ideas of OpenNARS, the event handling and procedure learning capabilities of ANSNA [2, 3], and the control model from ALANN [4]. The system is written in C, is more capable than our previous implementations, and has also been experimentally compared with Reinforcement Learning [5]. 

The ONA implementation has been developed with a pragmatic mindset. The focus on the design has been to implement the 'existing' theory [6, 7] as effectively as possible and make firm decisions rather than keep as many options open as possible. This has led to some small conceptual differences to OpenNARS [8] which was developed for research purposes.

***How to clone and compile (tested with GCC and Clang for x64, x86 and ARM):***

```
git clone https://github.com/opennars/OpenNARS-for-Applications
cd OpenNARS-for-Applications
./build.sh
```

***How to set the amount of threads the system should run with: (to be tested more, compile with ./build.sh -fopenmp)***
```
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4  // 4 threads seems to be the sweet spot. More threads leads to more contention and less speed currently
```

***How to run the interactive Narsese shell:***

```
./NAR shell
```

***with syntax highlighting:***

```
./NAR shell | python3 colorize.py
```

***with English NLP shell and syntax highlighting:***

```
python3 english_to_narsese.py | ./NAR shell | python3 colorize.py
```

***How to run the C tests and then receive instructions how to run the current example programs:***

```
./NAR
```

***How to run all C tests, and all Narsese and English examples as integration tests, and collect metrics across all examples:***

```
python3 evaluation.py
```

For the current output, see [Evaluation results](https://github.com/opennars/OpenNARS-for-Applications/wiki/Evaluation-Results-(Tests,-metrics))

**How to run an example file:**

Narsese:

```
./NAR shell < ./examples/nal/example1.nal
```

English: (tested with NLTK v3.4.5, v3.5)

```
python3 english_to_narsese.py < ./examples/english/story1.english | ./NAR shell
```

**How to run an UDPNAR:**

```
./NAR UDPNAR IP PORT timestep(ns per cycle) printDerivations
./NAR UDPNAR 127.0.0.1 50000 10000000 true
```

where the output can be logged simply by appending

```
> output.log
```
